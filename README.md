# Demo-model-for-oil-spilling
This repository contains the demo model for detecting oil spills in marine environments using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets. Developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024, our objective is to create an efficient system that identifies and monitors oil spill incidents to mitigate environmental impact.
